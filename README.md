## 📚 Practical Programs

### 1️⃣ [PrimitiveDataTypesDemo.java](./PrimitiveDataTypesDemo.java)
**Description**: Demonstrates the use of Java's primitive data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, and `boolean`.  
**Concepts**: Data types, arithmetic operations, type casting.  
**Output**: Shows basic arithmetic and character operations.

### 2️⃣ [Person.java](./Person.java)
**Description**: A simple class with private fields and public getter/setter methods to demonstrate **encapsulation**.  
**Concepts**: OOP, encapsulation, method access control.  
**Output**: Displays the name and age using getters after setting values through setters.

### 3️⃣ [GradeEvaluator.java](./GradeEvaluator.java)
**Description**: Accepts a numeric grade and determines the letter grade using `if-else` and `switch` statements.  
**Concepts**: Conditional statements, input handling using `Scanner`.  
**Output**: Outputs a message based on the grade classification (A, B, C...).

### 4️⃣ [LoopExamples.java](./LoopExamples.java)
**Description**: Demonstrates the use of `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.  
**Concepts**: Looping, flow control.  
**Output**: Prints numbers 1–10, even numbers 2–20, and countdown 10–1.

### 5️⃣ [AnimalSound.java](./AnimalSound.java)
**Description**: Shows how to override a method from a superclass. `Animal` is the base class, and `Dog` overrides `makeSound()`.  
**Concepts**: Inheritance, method overriding, polymorphism.  
**Output**: `"The dog barks"` — printed from the overridden method.

## 🧪 How to Compile and Run the Programs

Make sure you have Java installed. Then follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
javac FileName.java    # Compile the program
java FileName          # Run the program (without .java)
